Forest fires have serious consequences for ecology, public safety, and the economy. Vegetation degradation results in the loss of biodiversity and habitat for numerous species. Plant regeneration can be hampered by soil erosion and diminished fertility. Forest fires produce smoke, particulate matter, and poisonous compounds, all of which contribute to air pollution and health problems. Carbon dioxide emissions feed greenhouse gas emissions and limit trees' potential to function as carbon sinks. Forest fires harm lives, cause property damage, and pose health problems. They can have economic consequences, demanding costly resources for firefighting and disrupting businesses such as farming and tourism. Early identification of forest fires is critical for efficient firefighting and mitigation techniques, as it allows for quicker reactions, safety precautions, and resource allocation.
